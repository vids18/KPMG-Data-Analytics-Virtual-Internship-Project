# Virtual Internship Final Project
- KPMG
 
 KPMG in association with InsideSherpa has provided students an opportunity to have hands-on experience with their virtual internship program.
 
 The VI program is designed by the Data Analytics and Consultancy domain of one of the biggest accountancy firm in the entire world.The Analytics, Information & Modelling group helps organisations take the mystery out of big data and show them how to leverage their data resources to produce better business outcomes. I have uploaded the dataset provided by KPMG for the analysis.
 
 # Tasks Performed
  - Data Quality Assessment:-
            The importance of optimising the quality of customer datasets cannot be underestimated and we have analyse to help optimise the customer's marketing strategy. The better the quality of the dataset, the better chance will be able to use it drive company growth. The task is to review the data quality issues lying in the three customer datasets.
          
- Data Insights:-
            Targeting high value customers based on customer demographics and attributes. A powerpoint presentation is to be made which highlights Data Exploration, Model Development and Interpretation. A detailed approach for completing the analysis includes activities such as understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting.
            
- Data Insights and Presentation:-
             After building the model it is essential to showcase the findings to our clients. Visualisations such as interactive dashboards often help highlight key findings and convey ideas in a more succinct manner. Deliverables include developing a Tableau dashboard that displays the summary and results of the analysis.
